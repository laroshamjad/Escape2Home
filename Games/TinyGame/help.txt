
To play this game you must move between locations and interact with objects by typing one or two word commands.

Some commands are motion commands. These will move you from planet to planet.
You must only type these when you are asked to do so.
Motion commands include:

MemoryMaze, HiddenHaven, PuzzleMania, CosmicCode.

Note: choose your planets carefully, as some may cause you to experience an alien invasion!
Upon an alien invasion, you must successfully answer their questions,
and you may move on to your selected planet.

Further Note: If you have 5+ lives within an alien invasion, you will automatically be able to use your superheart.
Your superheart will allow you to not have any lives affected throughout the invasion.
If you have less than 5 lives, you are not elligible for a superheart, so play carefully!

There are other action commands in the game. These include:
HELP: this will display instructions

The game is over when your player has successfully won each game
and collected all tools to fix their spaceship, or when your player loses all lives.
