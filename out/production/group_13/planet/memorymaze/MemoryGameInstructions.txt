You have landed on planet Memory Maze. 
In Memory Maze, once the instructions clear, you will be given 10 seconds to view the 16 cards to match.
Once the ten seconds are up, you must click two of the cards to match them.
If the cards selected are not a pair, the cards will not flip over.
If the cards selected are the same, they will turn around to display the matching cards.
Every three incorrect picks will result in a lost life.
Play carefully and good luck!
